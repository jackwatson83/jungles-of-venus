# Jungles of Venus
Large (24-week) project completed as part of my Masters, in a group with 6 programmers mimicking the structure of an indie game studio.
Jungles of Venus was a vision from our lecturer who was playing the role of Creative Director, and our task was to build a prototype project to
satisfy his designs. The brief was to develop a Real-Time Strategy game in which players built and maintained a colony of units, exploring,
and developing the unexplored Jungles on the planet Venus, while defending themselves and their colony from the hostile environment.

# Tools Programming
To begin with, my role in the project was Tools Programmer - it was intended that I would develop tools to assist the rest of the team with 
their roles, but after developing 2 custom unity editor extensions, I realised that the team was behind schedule so moved over to help develop
other systems.

# Unit Behaviour and AI
My largest contribution to the project from a programming standpoint was the Task System - a flexible series of systems that allowed the
player to desginate tasks and jobs for individual (or groups of) colonists.
Colonist game objects themselves were another team member's responsibilty, however as they were new to Unity and C#, they asked for help
regarding inheritence and a stat system, so I quickly developed a simple Stat system, to allow easy manipulation of Colonist stats (for
example, Health and Energy), whilst also teaching my colleague about inheritence, abstract classes, and overriding base methods.

# Other Responsibilities
As well as programming large parts of the game, I took the reigns towards the end of the project to ensure that everything was connected up
correctly within the Unity Editor, especially the User Interface menus throughout the game. Over the course of the project, I helped to
manage the use of source control systems by the rest of the team, fixing any issues they had with it and any errors they encountered when
I looked at merging their work.
